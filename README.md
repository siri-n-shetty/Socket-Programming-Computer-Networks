# Socket-Programming

*Cryptographic Reverse String Communication Protocol using Socket Programming*

The CRSCP mini-project aims to design and implement a secure, efficient communication protocol that allows clients to send strings to a server, which performs operations on the strings and returns them to the client. This process incorporates encryption and decryption to ensure data privacy and security throughout the communication.

This was done as a Mini project for the course **Computer Networks (UE22CS252B)**.
